Guidelines
==========

----

Make success repeatable
-----------------

Give your workflow and tools the open source treatment

  * Use Semantic Versioning
  * Package managers for distribution
  * Keep your documentation up to date
  * Define (or share) your release workflow for every tool

----

Think in Interfaces
-------------------

----

Think in Interfaces
-------------------

* What are the places developers, stakeholders, and clients touch your process?
* Changing the way others interact with your process is a breaking change.
* Changing the implementation details is a minor change.
* Aim to make day-to-day development and onboarding seamless

----

Differences should be intentional
---------------------------------

* Differences between projects costs you money
* They might be worth it though!

----

Don't be Dogmatic
------------------

----

Documentation is Critical
-------------------------

* Your company needs a README
  * Outline your best practices
* Your tools need a README
  * Describe how to use the tool
* Every project needs a README
  * Highlight deviations in project documentation

----

Invest in Dev Ops
-----------------

This is a long term investment. Over the long run, you will:

* Increase efficiency
* Make your staff more productive
* Level up your developers faster
* Increase confidence and ability to deliver on complex projects
* Develop a new revenue stream or selling point for your company

----

Continuously Re-evaluate
------------------------

Dev Ops is about building feedback loops.  Your needs will evolve and change over time.

* Be honest and realistic about what's working
* Ask whether what you're doing is actually delivering value

----

Pick Good Partners
------------------

* Infrastructure partners should be aligned with your operational goals
* Make good recommendations for your clients - partners should align with their goals too
