Horizontal DevOps
-----------------

Often DevOps considiers a vertical silo of a project, what is the hosting, what is the dev pipeline, what is the QC and deploy pipeline.  That is important, but it is also important to step back and evaluate each of your projects verticals and compare and contrast them.

Our Background
--------------

We both work in agencies that touch a lot of projects on a regular basis. We both work in small companies (15-25 people).  Our competitive advantages lie in doing DevOps well, both on our company's respective projects, and as DevOps consultants for other companies. [STORY (speaking to why we're experts in building repeatable processes)]


Multiple competing ideas: 
DevOps - Everything should be uniform.
Developers want freedom to innovate/use new tech.
Reality is that older projects may come with legacy technology.
Clients: Don't want to pay for any of it, don't want any breakages due to future changes.

Devops > Everything should be static and rigid.
Developers > Let's replace Drupal core with Laravel!



Differences Should Be Intentional
----------------------------------

Differences cost money and introduce bugs.  Take time, require documentation, make it harder to stay in sync in the future.

When comparing all your projects for the dev, test, and deploy pipelines look to see where they are different and if there is opportunity for consolidation.  That could be on:

  * Tooling
  * Process
  * Automation

Minimizing differences in tooling, process and automation goes a long way to optimizing your human resources. If team members don't have to waist brain cycles on ramping into a project and can be plugged into the part they are best at with minumal effort you are doing gteat!

But...

Don't be Dogmatic
-----------------

It is easy to start this process by saying to yourself every stack is going to be the same: period.

Don't do that.  Give each project the opportunity to be unique. We don't want to choke the project. Every project will have different requirements and some different pieces; Our goal here is to minimize the differences, but still allow for them per project.

Needs to be Repeatable
----------------------

Being able to spin up the same stacks, interfaces, and pipelines accross projects needs to be repeatable.  This is where tools like docker come into play.  There are lots of tools to choose from to get the repeatability your team wants or needs. Which tools you pick is less important then the fact that you and your team think about and choose consistent tools across projects where poassible.

This repeatability directly ties into the developers being able to quickly plugin to projects where their expertise is required; hopefully without even noticing the DevOps.




STRATEGIES FOR DOING BETTER (as a company who needs horizontal dev-ops):


Documentation is Critical
-------------------------

Open up your docs!  Lots of companies are doing this, and it works well for collecting feedback.  

* [Tandem Docs](https://docs.thinktandem.io/) ~ you can view our docs today and see how we do it.

That doesn't mean you have to do it that way too, but you can get a baseline or comparison for a way forward.

* You should have a README.md for every project.
* Follow a common pattern for the docs in this README.md file.
* Reducing differences in projects gives the opportunity to efficiently highlight the differences of this project in the README.md withoug overwhelming the dev being onboarded.
* Employees should know how and feel comfortable contributing to the documentation.


Interfaces Matter; Implementation is Irrelevant
-----------------------------------------------
[QUOTE/DEFINITION OF INTERFACES IN SOFTWARE]

* Identify the interfaces (what are the tools your developers are using all day long?)
* The things that are used directly are your interfaces.  The things that are used indirectly are implementation details.
* Once you know your interfaces, make sure they're as consistent as they can be.  


### Identify your interfaces: By identifying your interfaces you will learn what's expensive/hard to change and what's easy.

### Actively work to refine/reduce your interfaces.  By doing this, you give developers the ability to pick up your projects quickly.

### Make concious decisions about the interfaces you choose.

If you can offer a consistent DX accross all of your projects, then you can reduce ramp up time on getting a developer up and running and productive on a project.

For example you might standardize on:

```bash
lando composer test
```

So the details of implementation here have several layers of complexity, and could even have different details per project, but from the perspective of a developer on there day to day work to run tests on any project you run `lando composer test`.


Invest in DevOps Process
------------------------

If you do not have dedicated DevOps people you should. A lot of companies don't know how or if it is worth it to get the ball rolling with DevOps ... the how is this presentation. The answer to is it worth it is YES!

- [ ] Give some of your team dedicated time to work on process, research tools, etc.
- [ ] Don't be afraid of allowing your team to try new technologies (not in production).
- [ ] Integrate your DevOps people to work with your development team.  They solve each other's problems if they know about them.
- [ ] Avoid bus problems by having multiple people on the DevOps team.

Tool Selection
--------------

Selecting your tools can be a daunting task! Here are some guidelines we find useful:

* Prefer Open Source
* Choose flexible tools over a very specific tool
* Is the project well known, have recent commits and a healthy issue queue?
* Pick your battles.  You don't need to decide on every tool.  Eg: Developers can be more efficient if their Code editors/OS  are their own.

Invest in Your Own Tools
---------------------

Caveat: Don't do this without a good reason.

- [ ] You create value for your company by building something germain to your specific use case.
- [ ] Open source your projects for glory and fame
- [ ] Can actually feed back into the marketing/sales pipeline.

Continuously Evaluate
---------------------

DevOps technology and paradigms change. Be flexible! Once you have some docs, tools, and pipelines give your DevOps team time and resources to research the landscape, see the new tools, pick some and evaluate them. Not in isolation, but to hwo they may fit into your pipeline either as a new thing, or a replacement for one or more of your things.

Avoid Bus Problems
